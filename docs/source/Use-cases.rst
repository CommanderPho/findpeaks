*SAR* and *SONAR* images are affected by *speckle* noise that inherently exists in and which degrades the image quality.
It is caused by the back-scatter waves from multiple distributed targets. It is locally strong and it increases the man Grey level of local area.
Reducing the noise enhances the resolution but tends to decrease the spatial resolution too.
