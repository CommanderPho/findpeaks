findpeaks's documentation!
==========================

*findpeaks* is Python package for the detection of peaks and valleys in a 1d-vector and 2d-array (images).
Peaks and valleys can be detected using **topology**, **mask**, and the **peakdetect** approach. In addition to peak-detection, various functions 
are readily available for pre-processing the data (denoising, normalizing, resizing), and vizualizing the data (3d-mesh, persistence)
